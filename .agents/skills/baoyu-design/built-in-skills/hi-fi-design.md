Create a high-fidelity, polished design.

Follow this general design process (use the todo list to remember):
(1) ask questions, (2) find existing UI kits and collect design context — copy ALL relevant components and read ALL relevant examples; ask the user if you can't find them, (3) start your file with assumptions + context + design reasoning (as if you are a junior designer and the user is your manager), with placeholders for the designs, and show it to the user early, (4) build out the designs and show the user again ASAP; append some next steps, (5) use your tools to check, verify and iterate on the design.

Good hi-fi designs do not start from scratch — they are rooted in existing design context. Ask the user to Import their codebase, or find a suitable UI kit / design resources, or ask for screenshots of existing UI. You MUST spend time trying to acquire design context, including components. If you cannot find them, ask the user for them. In the Import menu, they can link a local codebase, provide screenshots or Figma links; they can also link another project. Mocking a full product from scratch is a LAST RESORT and will lead to poor design. If stuck, try listing design assets and ls'ing design system files — be proactive! Some designs may need multiple design systems — get them all. Use the starter components (device frames and the like) to get high-quality scaffolding for free.

When presenting several options or explorations side-by-side, use the
`design-canvas.jsx` starter so each option is a labeled, movable artboard on
a neutral canvas. In the hosted product, also add
`<meta name="design_doc_mode" content="canvas">`; in a portable harness the
starter supplies the pan/zoom behavior. If the user must choose an option
before work can continue, ask with the harness's structured question flow
instead of treating the comparison canvas as an answer.

When designing, asking many good questions is ESSENTIAL.

Give options: try to give 3+ variations across several dimensions. Mix by-the-book designs that match existing patterns with new and novel interactions, including interesting layouts, metaphors, and visual styles. Have some options that use color or advanced CSS; some with iconography and some without. Start your variations basic and get more advanced and creative as you go! Try remixing the brand assets and visual DNA in interesting ways — play with scale, fills, texture, visual rhythm, layering, novel layouts, type treatments. The goal is not the perfect option; it's exploring atomic variations the user can mix and match.

CSS, HTML, JS and SVG are amazing. Users often don't know what they can do. Surprise the user.

If you do not have an icon, asset or component, draw a placeholder: in hi-fi
design, a placeholder is better than a bad attempt at the real thing. When a
real asset (illustration, texture, hero image, icon) would clearly beat a
placeholder *and* an image backend is available, generate it — see
[`generate-images.md`](generate-images.md). Photography is the exception:
place an `<image-slot>` and prefill it with an attributed stock photo when
stock search is available, so the user can still replace or recrop it. A
clean placeholder still beats a poor generated substitute.
