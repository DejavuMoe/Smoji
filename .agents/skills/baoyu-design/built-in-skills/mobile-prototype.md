description: "Mobile prototype\nPin-to-home-screen-ready mobile prototype"
---
The user is building a mobile prototype that they'll open on an iPhone
and pin to their home screen. Emit a single self-contained HTML file
that is ready for that flow by default — don't ask first.

## Required <head> tags

Always include these, otherwise the "pin to home screen" banner won't
trigger in the preview and the prototype won't install cleanly:

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
    <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
    <meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
    <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent">
    <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="<short prototype title>">
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="icon.png">
    <link rel="icon" href="icon.png">

## App icon

Create an icon.png in the project root (512×512, square, no
transparency on the edges — iOS masks it to a rounded square itself).
Make a simple, bold mark that reads at small sizes: a single glyph or
monogram on a solid or two-tone background. Avoid photo backgrounds,
tiny type, or gradient washes that muddy at 60×60. If the user hasn't
specified a brand, pick a deliberate single accent color and use it
consistently across the icon and the prototype UI.

## Layout — full-bleed with device inset on desktop

By default, the page should fill the entire viewport on phone widths
(safe-area insets honoured via env(safe-area-inset-*)) — no page
chrome, no max-width container, edge-to-edge content. The status bar
area should feel intentional (matching background or a gradient that
tucks under the notch).

On large viewports (min-width: 700px), center the app inside a
device-sized inset rectangle so the designer can see it as a "phone on
desktop" during iteration. Target ~390×844 for the phone frame, round
the corners (~40px), and drop it in a soft background. Example:

    html, body { margin: 0; height: 100%; overscroll-behavior: none; }
    body {
      background: #111;
      display: grid;
      place-items: center;
    }
    #app {
      width: 100vw;
      height: 100vh;
      background: <app bg>;
      padding-top: env(safe-area-inset-top);
      padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
    }
    @media (min-width: 700px) {
      #app {
        width: 390px;
        height: 844px;
        border-radius: 44px;
        overflow: hidden;
        box-shadow: 0 30px 80px rgba(0,0,0,0.35);
      }
    }

## No fake chrome

Do NOT draw a fake iOS status bar (the "9:41 · battery · wifi" strip
at the top) or a fake virtual keyboard at the bottom. When the
prototype is installed to the home screen, the real iOS status bar
and real keyboard render on top of your layout — a painted fake looks
doubled up and childish. Leave that space alone and let
env(safe-area-inset-top) / env(safe-area-inset-bottom) reserve the
room. The same applies on the desktop device-frame preview: no fake
status bar inside the phone rectangle.

Wrap your app content in <div id="app">. Navigation, state,
transitions, forms — everything that makes it feel like a real app —
should all work inside that single file. No external build, no CDN
dependencies beyond what's already allowed in the normal prototype
workflow.
