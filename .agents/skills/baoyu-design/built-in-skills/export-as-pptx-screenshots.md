# Screenshot PPTX Export

> **Not the default** — use only when the user explicitly wants pixel-perfect, non-editable image slides; otherwise use [editable export](export-as-pptx-editable.md).

Export an HTML slide deck to a `.pptx` as full-bleed PNG images. Pixel-perfect, not editable. One `gen_pptx` tool call.

> **Precondition — decks only, not any HTML.** Same as editable export: this targets a *slide-structured deck* (one fixed-size slide per `selector`, navigable — `deck-stage` or the [make-a-deck](make-a-deck.md) format), **not** arbitrary HTML. For a non-deck page, rebuild it as a deck first or tell the user it isn't supported.

## Steps

1. Surface/preview the deck per your selected harness reference.
2. Call `gen_pptx`:

> **Claude Code:** there is no `gen_pptx` tool — run it as a local CLI. Serve the deck over HTTP, write the inputs below (with `"mode": "screenshots"`) to a JSON file, then `node <skill>/agents/gen-pptx/dist/cli.mjs --url <servedDeckUrl> --config <jsonPath> --out designs/<project>`, and read `flags` from the printed JSON. Full invocation + one-time setup: [`../references/claude.md`](../references/claude.md) → "Exporting to PPTX".

```jsonc
{
  "mode": "screenshots",
  "width": 1920, "height": 1080,
  "slides": [
    { "showJs": "goToSlide(0)", "selector": "body" },  // selector unused in screenshot mode but required
    { "showJs": "goToSlide(1)", "selector": "body" }
  ],
  "hideSelectors": [".nav", ".progress"],
  // No resetTransformSelector in screenshot mode — the iframe is locked to
  // width × height for capture, so the deck's own responsive scaling fills it.
  "filename": "my-deck"
}
```

`slides[].delay` defaults to 600ms — bump if transitions are slower.

### If the deck uses the `<deck-stage>` starter component

- `slides[N].showJs`: `"document.querySelector('deck-stage').goTo(N)"` — 0-indexed, so slide 1 is `goTo(0)`.
- `hideSelectors` is unnecessary — the overlay and tap-zones live in shadow DOM and aren't captured.

## Validation

Same flags as editable mode, except `reset_selector_miss` and `slide_size_mismatch` won't fire — the iframe is locked to width × height instead of fiddling with the deck's wrapper. Watch for `duplicate_adjacent` (showJs didn't navigate).

Screenshot mode exports flat images, so `data-anim` builds are NOT exported — slides are captured in their final layout, and the `animations_ignored_screenshots` flag reports any that were skipped. Use the [editable export](export-as-pptx-editable.md) to keep animations. When the flag fires, tell the user in plain language — e.g. "this export is pixel-perfect but static: the N slide builds don't play in it; I can re-export as editable PPTX to keep them as real PowerPoint animations" — and offer the editable export.
