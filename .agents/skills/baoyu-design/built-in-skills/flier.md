Design a print-ready, single-page flier as one self-contained HTML
file: exactly one fixed-size page.

Sheet setup:
- START by calling copy_starter_component with kind: "doc_page.js",
  then build the flier as ONE explicitly paginated page:
  <doc-page><section class="page" id="flier">…</section></doc-page>.
  The component owns the page box, the desk background that
  disappears at print, the page break discipline, and all print
  geometry — do NOT write your own @page rule, body background, or
  hard-coded paper dimensions, and never add an omelette-owns-print
  meta. The print dialog must show exactly 1 page.
- The flier prints as a FIXED full-bleed page box with overflow
  hidden — letter by default, the user's chosen paper (letter, A4, …)
  when they export — so content that misses the box is clipped, never
  reflowed. Design the flier to FILL the page box and fit letter and
  A4 alike without overlap.
- The page is full-bleed: the flier owns its own inset — keep a
  visual margin of at least 4% of the page on every edge, and keep
  everything inside it.
- Never viewport units (vh/vw) — they track the window, not the page.

A flier is read at a distance, in passing, in under three seconds:
- One dominant element — usually a headline under ~6 words — sized so
  it reads across a room (think 8cqh+), everything else clearly
  subordinate.
- The five Ws grouped tight and scannable: what, when, where, cost,
  and one way to act (QR-sized URL, phone number, or tear-off) — not
  scattered through prose.
- Strong flat color blocks and vector shapes over photos and
  gradients; high contrast; body text in near-black on light stock.
- Generous whitespace beats more words — cut copy until the hierarchy
  is unmissable.
- Optional: a tear-off fringe along the bottom edge (a row of
  narrow cells with dashed left borders and rotated contact text) when
  the user wants phone-number slips.

Check the print preview: nothing clipped, nothing spilling to page
two, colors that still work in grayscale.
